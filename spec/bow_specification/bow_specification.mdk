# Introduction 

The Bunch of Wires (BoW) specification is a very simple, open and interoperable 
physical interface between any 2 or more  chiplets or chip-scale-packages (CSP) 
on a common package.

## Overview

This specification will describe the BoW interface.  The specification also leaves 
open the possibility of pin-compatible interfaces that operate at higher data rates 
for increased throughput per chip edge.  This specification also describes a 
terminated mode that operates at increased data rates.  It is also possible 
that in the future other BoW-compatible technology enhancements will further 
increase throughput per chipedge.  Examples of this include previous discussions 
on a Turbo mode using simultaneous bidirectional communication.  That mode is not 
covered in this draft.

### Objectives

The BoW interface is intended to meet the following design objectives:

* Be inexpensive to implement 
* Portable across process nodes ranging from 28nm to 5nm
* Portable across multiple bump pitches
* Have the Flexibility to support advancing packaging technology
* Be unencumbered by technology license costs
* Very low power (<`pJ/bit)
* Very low latency

### Advantages

The Bunch of Wires interface provides several key advantages for chiplet based systems:

* Can operate at higher data rates per pin than existing parallel standards
  *  -or-  lower data rates for compatibility with existing parallel standards
* Can be implemented in legacy technologies (process nodes) with generally available IP
* Terminated mode can be implemented in less effort than a traditional SERDES
* Does not require silicon based interconnect
* Is not constrained or intended to be used with a specific bump pitch
  * Two BoW interfaces can each be implemented at different bump pitches and can be 
  directly connected on an organic substrate, through fanout technology or through 
  silicon based interconnect.

While the advantages and simplicity are excellent benefits, the BoW interface does 
require more package routing traces than other serial based XSR or USR interconnect.
This drives BoW implementations that need the highest bandwidth to use fine bump 
pitches and ‘stacked’ BoW implementations, adding some complexity and cost in test 
and packaging.  Lower bandwidth implementations are free to use more standard 
packaging technology with coarse bump pitch.

### Scope
The scope of this document and of any contributions to this document are limited to:

1. The specification of the BoW interface that specifies the following functionality:
  a. Operating modes
  b. Physical design
  c. Test and testability
  d. Operation
  e. Management controls
  f. Methods to verify and validate compliance with this specification
  g. Recommended bump patterns and signal ordering
  h. Performance estimates
  i. Other functions or design practices that may be deemed necessary to meet the 
  design objectives listed above

2. The following activities are outside the scope of this document and contributions 
to this document:
  a. Physical implementations of the interface
  b. Integration of the interface with system-level data flow e.g. adapting a 
  standard PHY-layer abstraction such as PIPE interface to the BoW
  c. The actual use of this interface in systems
  d. The use of this interface outside a package

3. The following activities are intended to be addressed in subsequent versions 
of this specification:
  a. Test enablement
  b. Compliance points
  c. Initialization
  d. Security

### Compliance Summary

Table summarizes the compliance points that shall be met in order to meet the BoW requirements. Each of the 
compliance points is discussed in the specification.

This section will also include a discussion on interoperability.

<to be completed in subsequent draft>

## BoW Architecture
The BoW interfaces implement a physical-layer or PHY interconnect protocol, implementing 
Layer 1 of the 5-layer TCP/IP reference model.

### BoW Configurations

There are multiple possible BoW configurations. All versions of the implementation must be 
interoperable with the minimum definition. All implementations are source synchronous 
parallel interfaces using a differential clock.  Beyond the basic implementation, 
adding termination provides higher performance per mm of beachfront bandwidth but is more 
complex to design. 

* All BoW configurations are intended to be used in multi-chiplet designs
* The full range of operating frequencies is expected to be documented in a data sheet. 
* All BoW implementations uses source synchronous clocking with data transmission aligned 
to clock edges.

The separate implementation of the interface are specified such that they can be connected 
to one another. ** When two interfaces are connected, data rate for the operating mode must be 
configured such that both ends support the data rate.**

All BoW implementations must support the minimum configuration of BoW (2Gbps datarate, 
1 Ghz clock rate, un-terminated IO)

* The throughput per wire on a BoW interface implementation will be affected by:
* The choice of packaging technology
* The physical distance between the chiplets being connected: Faster data rates may be easier 
with chiplets that are physically closer 
* Bump spacing: Coarse bumps may allow for circuitry to enable faster data rates.

The BoW specification provides for optional technology to increase the data rate per wire. 
But it is also possible for basic BoW implementation implemented with advanced packaging or 
between physically close chiplets to offer a higher data rate per wire than a terminated 
BoW interface in some configurations.

A high level view of the BoW Interface Data-rate ranges is shown below:

![bowspec_figure2]

[bowspec_figure2]: images/bowspec_figure2.jpg "bowspec_figure2" { width:auto; max-width:100% }

Note that the BoW Unterminated mode can support datarates of >5Gbps only when trace length 
is minimized (<1mm) due to reflections.

#### BoW 
A BoW implementation shall support a clock rate no greater than 2.5 Gigahertz (GHz) / 5 Gbps 
DDR data rate for typical trace lengths and 4.0 GHz / 8 Gbps DDR data rate  for traces <1mm.  
DDR is double datarate defined as one data bit per rising and falling edge of the clock. 
Laminate trace lengths for BoW mode should be limited to 10mm to avoid reflections.

#### Terminated mode
Termination mode is expected to use lane termination to minimize signal reflection and 
improve the data rate per line, improving the data rate per millimeter of chiplet edge. 
Data is always expected to be transmitted at the Double Data Rate. A terminated 
implementation shall support a minimum clock rate no greater than 8 GHz and Double 
Data Rate operation.

### BoW Interface
The BoW interface defines three signal types:

* Data signals
  * Inputs (RX): data input signals received by the interface
 * Outputs (TX): data output signals transmitted from the interface
* Clocks
  * Data clock out (ns_fwd_clk), sent to the receiving chiplet
  * Data clock in (fs_fwd_clk): received from the receiving chiplet
* FEC
  * Optional FEC bits (1 bit recommended)

# Design Assumptions
Short connections\
Organic substrate spacing\
Low loss implementations\
Need low end2end latency\
Low power\

# Standard Compatibility
The Bunch of Wires (BoW) is a simple Double Data Rate source synchronous interface 
that has much in common with other parallel interfaces including Intel AIB, High 
Bandwidth Memory and other simple source synchronous interfaces.

* A defined dataword width of 16 data bits per differential clock
* Support only for Double Data Rate (DDR) mode to simplify clocking
* Multiple supported datarates and modes
    * BoW Unterminated is most similar to AIB using un-terminated CMOS IO 
    to reduce power at low datarates
    * BoW Terminated uses terminated IO to improve SI and datarates

Due to reduced ESD requirements, the BoW specification is not expected to be 
compliant to off-package IO standards, though it may interoperate with other 
chiplets using CMOS IO buffers.

## Supported Datarates
BOW supports the following datarates:

|----------|-------------|-------|-----------|------------|------------------|

+--------- +------------ +-------+-----------+------------+------------------+
~

At a minimum all BoW implementations must support the minimum 1 Ghz clock rate, 
2Gbps datarate using unterminated IO.  For ease of integration, increased 
datarates should support 1 Gbps increments from the floor 2Gbps datarate.

## Clocking
Rising to rising and rising to falling edge specifications for the TX clock 
rate (TXCLK pin) must achieve better than +/- 5% accuracy.

Additional requirements will be documented in future releases of the specification.

# Electrical Specifications

## Voltages
Where possible BoW IO should reside on the VDD rail to simplify design of chiplets 
and provide current to controller logic from the BoW recommended bump patterns.
All BoW implementations must support a range of voltages from 0.75 V nominal to 0.8 V nominal.
These voltages must be supported with +/- 5% tolerance at the bump, 0.7125 V to 0.84 V.
Other lower or higher voltages may be supported beyond the required range.

## ESD Requirements
BOW IO should be designed to support 50 V CDM (Charged Device Model) and 
250 V HBM (Human Body Model).  This requirement is similar to other die to die 
interface standards.

## Termination Requirements
BoW datarates (Typically 5Gbps, up to 8Gbps for <1mm trace length) do not 
require termination.  Higher datarates (up to 16 Gbps) requires termination, 
and must be built with selectable termination.

## Target Channel Requirements

### Channel loss line limits

![bowspec_figure4]

[bowspec_figure4]: images/bowspec_figure4.jpg "bowspec_figure4" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

BoW channel limit is limited by the round trip reflection delay and limited to <10mm for 
a 5Gbaud with proper slew rate control

Enabling termination enables longer channel regardless of baud rate, but to minimize 
the equalization requirement, it shall meet the provided Insertion Loss limit line.

### Return loss line limits

![bowspec_figure5]

[bowspec_figure5]: images/bowspec_figure5.jpg "bowspec_figure5" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

BoW channel is expected to be unterminated in the default mode and does not need to 
follow any Return Loss spec. 

Enabling Termination mode requires meeting the provided Return Loss limit line for 
proper operation and meeting target BER.

### Power Sum Crosstalk Limit Line

~center
![bowspec_figure6]

[bowspec_figure6]: images/bowspec_figure6.jpg "bowspec_figure6" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

Crosstalk is defined in form of the sum of crosstalk power of all aggressors on a target trace.
~

The proposed power-sum crosstalk spec for termination mode:
PS Xtalk Limit = -10 dB -37dB.e^(-f/8GHz)

A victim trace in between two aggressor traces on the same package substrate layer with air 
gap spacing of 50 um (or more) with at least a reference plane under or above will meet the 
proposed power-sum crosstalk limit.

\<To be completed in subsequent version of specification>

# Physical Constraints

## Signal Ordering

## Preferred Bump Patterns
BoW does not dictate a specific bump pitch but does have a defined bump pattern.
By not specifying a bump pitch, implementations can be built on both legacy and 
leading edge technologies.  Specifying a signal pattern, however, allows package 
routing between interfaces with limited signal crossings.

BoW can be implemented with any number of stacked interfaces, however such stacking 
should implement the bump pattern with an alternating stagger of signals.
